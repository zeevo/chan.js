My main concerns are: -A good vidya experience (performance, compatability, etc) I have no problem with configuring and messing with settings a bit for an optimal gaming system -Piracy. Is this distro cucked by missing libraries or software that makes piracy more difficult, and how easy is it to work around -The KDE experience. I only want KDE as my desktop environment.
